Welcome to SimpleDS
===================

SimpleDS provides a simple Java-to-Entity framework that maps java classes
to persistent entities, getting as little in the way as possible. What you 
get is barely a wrapper around Datastore APIs, providing mapping between 
Entity and Java classes.

 * simpleds.jar 			The jar with java classes
